# Customer-segmentation-Profiling-Recommendations

__Introduction__:<br>
The key to the business success is to fulfill customer's expectations and enhance their satisfaction. Having said that, not all customers behave in the same manner and not all of them are equally worthwhile our efforts. Given the limited resources and the profits maximization objective, it is important to think of how to treat different customers in the most effective and efficient way. That is the motivation for me to do this work: To try to put customers into groups sharing some characteristics so that the business could come up with customized plans to approach these groups of buyers

__Tasks__:<br>
+ In this project, I conducted cohort analysis and RFM segmentation to cluster customers into groups. Then I profiled each group and proposed some recommendations to boost the profits from them. 
+ The dataset having around 1 million of rows is the transactional data collected by an online retail platform. More information about the dataset:<br> https://www.kaggle.com/nathaniel/uci-online-retail-ii-data-set<br>

Without further ado, let's' dive into it
